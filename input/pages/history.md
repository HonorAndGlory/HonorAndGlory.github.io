# A Short History

- I started playing LOTRO sometime during 2008 (beta?).
- I started playing on Windfola, mostly because it was the least full server.
- My first character was Tarelion, an Elf Hunter, but Melyriel, an Elf Loremaster would become my main within a few weeks.
- My first kinship was **Narsil's Edge**.
- Klista and I formed **Heroes of the Last Alliance** after leaving Narsil's Edge.
- Wanting to participate in more raids, I joined my friend Dallasg's kinship **Honor and Glory** with my main
- Windfola shutdown and I mostly migrated to Arkenstone. Unfortunately, I had once created a Rune-keeper on another server, also named Melyriel, that was auto-transferred to Arkenstone. Strangely, I couldn't access that character to rename it, so my main lived with a -2 after my name for many years. (-1 belonging to the free test character I made before transferring).
- Went inactive for many years
- Played a little on the Legendary server Anor, with a new Loremaster named Melyriel. :D
- Anor shutdown in August 2022.
- Transferred new Anor Melyriel to Arkenstone and it gave me the name as the existing one was inactive for over a year. I deleted Anor Melyriel and was able to rename Melyriel-2 to her proper name. Yay!
