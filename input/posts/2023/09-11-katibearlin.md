Meet Katibearlin, a level 45 Beorning.

I created her as a new character as part of starting to play LOTRO again. Beorning has been pretty fun to play. It's a lot faster than I remember levelling a Guardian.

I've just reached level 45 and am eager to see the changes for legendary items. I probably won't be able to complete the quest line for at least a few levels though.

Katibearlin is a member of a kinship called **The Ancients** on Arkenstone. I joined them on 7/31 and they've been a chill and relaxed kin.
