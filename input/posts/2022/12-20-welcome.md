# Welcome

Welcome to my Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO) blog!

<!--more-->

Every once in a while I login to my account to check in game mail,
pay my housing upkeep, and spend some time visiting the places in game
to reminisce, but it's been a very long time since I've played and many
of the people I played with have moved onto other games or things.

One of the things that lowered my enthusiasm to play was that my main
character had lost her name in the transfer from Windfola to Arkenstone.
Sure, she still had the same name with "-2" suffixed onto to end. It
should've been a minor annoyance, but it bothered me that the character
I'd been playing since beta couldn't have her "real" name.

However, as luck would have it, many years ago LOTRO opened a *Legendary*
server called Anor, which reset the clock back to the game prior to any
expansions. I recreated my Elven Loremaster and played the game with a
few old friends that I started with so many years before.

In August of 2022, Anor closed as it had caught up with the current
expansions and was no longer needed. As a result, everyone was offered
a free transfer to another server. I took that as an opportunity to
transfer her to Arkenstone and possibly reclaim my original name.

And it **worked**! After the transfer my Anor Melyriel had reclaimed
the name from the usurper. A few quick renames and I had everything
back to where it should've been.
